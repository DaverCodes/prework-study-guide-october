# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

From utilizing skills taught in ththe pre work module- I was able to build this website. Building this website is proof that I dont just want to learn coding, it shows that I have the ability to do so, so I'm glad that I've accomplised this task!ki 

On top of that I now have a very accesible notepad that is only usable with skills Ive obtained along the way. 

I knew nothing getting into this proccess, but now I've become accuanted with 4 different coding programs and I've learned how every one of them can work together and is necessary to create a finished product.
